git init

2)
git add
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). 
There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.

3)
git commit
Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.
